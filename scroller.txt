--- check out for latest version and sources from github.com/laurikka --- play advice: move around with joystick in port 2 and collect all pixies, no fire button needed in this game.    collecting the colors in correct order is rewarded both in time and points so pay attention to the sequence.   the game is designed to be played on tac-2 or similar quick action joystick.    a low latency setup like a real hardware or mister on crt will make obtaining high scores much easier.    the idea to make a game had been brewing for a while now. originally it was to be a very simple one screen sprite based game for us to play on our game nights where we play old games on crt-tubes.    it is still basically in those specs but it is already a lot more refined than a minimum playable version would be. that being said i did of course run out of time and had to do decisions on what to work on these last days.     making this game and learning to code 6502 with assembler has been the best puzzle game i have ever played.   i used vs code, vasm, exomizer and denise as my main coding tools.
