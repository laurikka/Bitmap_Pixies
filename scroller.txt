--- v0.9x, check out for latest version and sources from github.com/laurikka --- the game is designed to be played on tac-2 or similar quick action joystick.    a low latency setup like a real hardware or mister on crt will make obtaining high scores much easier.    the idea to make a game had been brewing for a while now. originally it was to be a very simple one screen sprite based game for me and friends to play on our game nights where we play old games on crt-tubes.    it is still basically in those specs but it is already a lot more refined than a minimum playable version would be.      making this game and learning to code 6502 with assembler has been the best puzzle game i have ever played.   i used vs code, vasm, exomizer and denise as my main coding tools.    after the initial development on windows machine i switched to linux. all the tools are still basically the same since i was using wsl for compiling and crunching with linux versions anyway. now instead of vscode i'm using vscodium, which is just stripped down version withouth the bloatware. also retrodebugger was causing problems when launched from command line in windows but now works much better.
