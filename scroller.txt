--- check out for latest version and sources from github.com/laurikka --- play advice: move around with joystick in port 2 and collect all pixies, no fire button needed in this game.    collecting the colors in correct order is rewarded both in time and points so pay attention to the sequence.   the game is designed to be played on tac-2 or similar quick action joystick.    a low latency setup like a real hardware or mister on crt will make obtaining high scores much easier.    the idea to make a game had been brewing for a while now. originally it was to be a very simple one screen sprite based game for us to play on our game nights where we play old games on crt-tubes.    it is still basically in those specs but it is already a lot more refined than a minimum playable version would be. that being said i did of course run out of time and had to do decisions on what to work on these last days. as i'm writing this scroller i still have plenty of small bugs that i hope i can squash before friday's deadline but let's see. the biggest annoyance lately has been that i can't get the high score sort to work properly.     making this game and learning to code 6502 with assembler has been the best puzzle game i have ever played.   i used vs code, vasm, exomizer and denise as my main tools. the moving sprites were made in black magic fusion and the levels were done in houdini. i wrote simple python scripts to convert tga to binary and back.
